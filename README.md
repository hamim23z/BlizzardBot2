# Blizzard Bot - Old Version

### Project Recap

A Discord bot used for my old Discord Server. The purpose of this bot was to convert shoe sizes between countries, give recommended companies to buy sneaker bots and proxies from, 
and it also checked the security of certain websites. I discontinued this bot and began using BlizzardBot1. The link for the code regarding BlizzardBot1 can be found at https://github.com/hamim23z/BlizzardBot1
